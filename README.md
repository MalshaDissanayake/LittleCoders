# LittleCoders Project

## Overview
The LittleCoders project aims to analyze and document coding courses available for children aged 11-16 in Sri Lanka. The project includes data collection, analysis, and comprehensive documentation of the findings. The repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the work done.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Dataset
- **Dataset.xlsx**: Contains the original and cleaned data in two separate sheets:
  - **Raw Data**: Unprocessed data collected from various sources.
  - **Cleaned Data**: Data that has been cleaned and prepared for analysis, specifically used in the R analysis.

- **Updated_Dataset.xlsx**: Contains an updated version of the dataset with both the original and cleaned data:
  - **Raw Data**: Unprocessed data collected from various sources.
  - **Cleaned Data**: Updated data used for Python analysis, with an additional column, "Payment Method for course fee."

### 2. Course_Details
- This folder contains PDF files detailing specific courses (available only for some courses).

### 3. Analysis
- **LittleCoders.R**: R script used for the analysis of the cleaned data from `Dataset.xlsx`.
- **analysis.py**: Python script containing all the Python code used for data analysis, utilizing the cleaned data from `Updated_Dataset.xlsx`.

### 4. Documentation
- **LittleCoders.Rmd**: RMarkdown file containing the R code used for documentation.
- **LittleCoders.html**: The final knitted HTML document generated from `LittleCoders.Rmd`.
- **Documentation.md**: Markdown file with the completed documentation, including relevant Python code and plots.
- **plots/**: This folder contains all the PNG files used in `Documentation.md` for visualization purposes.

### 5. Environment Files
- **pyproject.toml**: Configuration file for managing Python dependencies using Poetry.
- **poetry.lock**: Lock file generated by Poetry to ensure consistent and reproducible environments.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **R**: Required to run the `LittleCoders.R` and `LittleCoders.Rmd` files.
- **Python**: Required to run the `analysis.py` file.
- **Poetry**: Used to manage Python dependencies.
- **RMarkdown**: Required to generate the documentation from `LittleCoders.Rmd`.

### Setting Up the Python Environment
1. Ensure you have Poetry installed.
2. Run the following command in the root directory of the repository to install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
3. Activate the Poetry environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

### Running the Analysis
1. **R Analysis**:
   - Navigate to the `Analysis` folder.
   - Run `LittleCoders.R` in your R environment.
   - Uses the cleaned data from `Dataset.xlsx`.

2. **Python Analysis**:
   - Navigate to the `Analysis` folder.
   - Run `analysis.py` in the Poetry environment.
   - Uses the cleaned data from `Updated_Dataset.xlsx`.

### Viewing the Documentation
- Open `LittleCoders.html` in your web browser to view the knitted HTML document.
- Alternatively, you can view the documentation in markdown format by opening `Documentation.md`.
